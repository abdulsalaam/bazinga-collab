We planed problem statement of document collaborate and signing using future technologies Blockchain and  Self-sovereign identity but due to time boundation team could not submitted full solution.

As below high level architecture diagram and features whatewver we provide by solution

Objectives >>
A zero-trust datastore encompasses the ability to store private information locally, while maintaining trust and authenticity globally.
Using decentralized constructs, like an Ethereum Claims Registries, alongside the uPort SimpleSigner libraries, itâ€™s possible to store encrypted data on a smartphone and pass that information back to servers and applications without losing trust in its authenticity.
Save information locally. Share data globally.
Support document sign by multiple parties.
Validates documents with a digital signature using a strong hash algorithm
Sign legal documents onscreen or upload scanned signature
Self-sovereign identity and user-centric data platform on Ethereum
Provide document collaboration to other users with very high security mechanism.
